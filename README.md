Pandas Homework
The PyCitySchools folder contains 2 Jupyter notebooks.
The PyCitySchools.ipynb file contains my final code with a few lines of observable trends from the data.
The PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb file is the original code provided from the instructor for the homework along with examples of what the data should look like in the end.
